# Dynamic Data Table - Final


This project is a fully dynamic and responsive Data Table web application built using Next.js, Redux Toolkit, and Material UI. It allows users to view, search, sort, and manage tabular data with features like inline editing, row deletion, and pagination (10 rows per page). Users can dynamically add or hide columns through a “Manage Columns” modal, reorder them via drag-and-drop, and persist visibility settings using Redux Persist or localStorage. The table also supports CSV import (using PapaParse) and export (using FileSaver.js) for easy data handling. The interface is fully responsive and optimized for both desktop and mobile. To run this project on another system, simply clone the GitHub repository using git clone <repo-url>, navigate into the folder with cd frontend-surfey, install all dependencies using npm install, and start the development server with npm run dev. The project will then be available locally at http://localhost:3000.
